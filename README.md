# FuseMount

This is a GUI frontend for sshfs.
Personally I use sshfs a lot to connect to remote servers to work on them.
With this GUI frontend it is more comfortable to (dis-)connect mounts.
It is possible to create groupos an (un)mount them at the same time.

This program requires KDE framework.

build example:
cd build/ && cmake .. && make
sudo make install
